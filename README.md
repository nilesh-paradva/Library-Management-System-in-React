<h3>Project Overview:-</h3>
<p>Develop a Library Management System that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books. The application will be built using React for the front-end, Redux for state management, Axios for making HTTP requests, and JSON Server to simulate a RESTful backend API.</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<h3>1: Create Book:</h3>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Users can add new books to the library.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Book details include title, author, genre, and publication year.</p>

<h3>2: Read Books:</h3>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Display a list of all books available in the library.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Each book entry shows the title, author, genre, and publication year.</p>

<h3>3&nbsp;&nbsp;Update Book:</h3>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Users can edit the details of an existing book.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes are reflected both in the UI and the backend.</p>

<h3>4&nbsp;&nbsp;Delete Book:</h3>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Users can delete a book from the library.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;The deleted book is removed from both the UI and the backend.</p>

<h3>5&nbsp;&nbsp;State Management with Redux:</h3>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Centralized state management for the entire application.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Actions and reducers to handle the state changes for book operations.</p>

<h3>6&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP Requests with Axios:</h3>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Fetch books from the backend.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Send POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to the backend for creating, updating, and deleting books.</p>

<h3>7&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTP Requests with Axios:</h3>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Use JSON Server to simulate a RESTful API.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Store book data in a JSON file (db.json).</p>

<h3>8&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsive UI:</h3>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensure the application is user-friendly and works well on different devices.</p>

<h3>Project Timeline:</h3>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup and initialize the project.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Configure JSON Server with a db.json file.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Set up Redux store, actions, and reducers.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Create a basic UI and implement the Read operation to display books.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Implement the Create operation with a form to add new books.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Implement the Update operation with a form to edit existing books.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Implement the Delete operation with a button to remove books.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Add basic styling and ensure the application is responsive.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Implement error handling and loading states for better UX.</p>
